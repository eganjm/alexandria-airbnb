You can park in any open spot outside the building or in the garage except for spaces marked 'Future Resident Parking' (outside) or 'Reserved' (garage). The reserved spots in the garage are marked on the pavement in front of the spot.</p><p>Starting at <b>10pm</b>, parked cars will need to display an overnight parking pass visible on your car dashboard. Overnight passes are <b>$10/night</b>.</p><p><b><i>Unauthorized vehicles (i.e., not displaying a parking pass) are subject to towing after 10pm.</i></b></p><p>I recommend as one of your first orders of business after arrival, is to go ahead and purchase your parking pass for the number of nights you are staying.

  { id: 52, question: "What if the elevator is not working?", answer: "I hope that you do not have to click on this, but there have been some ongoing issues with the elevator in Bldg. 5950. If it  is not working, please shoot me a text or give me a call at 903-244-7661 so I can open a maintenance ticket. There is a stairwell just past the elevators then take a left and it will be on the right at the end of the hall. If you are trying to use the elevator from the garage, there is Stairwell C you can take. If you are coming out of the doors to the elevator back into the garage, Stairwell C is about 50 feet diagonal to the left (see pic below).<p><img src='images/stairwell.PNG' style='width: 45%; height: auto;'></p>" },
